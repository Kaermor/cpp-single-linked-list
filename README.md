# Single-linked list
Project: single-linked list

An analog of the std::forward_list container. The BasicIterator template class is implemented, based on it constant and non-const list iterators are declared. The list class provides constant and non-const versions of the begin and end methods, which return iterators to the first element of the container and the position following the last element. To conveniently obtain constant iterators, there are cbegin and cend methods.

## Deployment and requirements
C++17. No additional requirements. Include the single_linked_list.h header file in your project.
